!!Please note!!
 -000webhost which my site runs on doesn't open when using campus air wifi due to some firewall restriction most likley.
 -for some reason my website on 000webhost displays captions without styling, even though it works locally without issue, the captions are not black, rather white and centered below the videos


Hello, thanks for taking a look at my website, I had tons of fun playing around to make my website where it is now.

The Website consists of 4 HTML file and 3 CSS files (Please disregard the contact copy1.HTMLfile as i am not sure how to remove it from Github repo, srry!)

The 4 HTML files are:
index.HTML     (Homepage)
aboutme.HTML   (Introduction)
contact.HTML   (Feedback Form)
projects.HTML  (Project Showcase)

The 3 CSS files are:
full.CSS    (for desktop viewing)
tablet.CSS  (for tablet viewing)
phone.CSS   (for phone viewing)


I have 2 instances where I used code outside of what I learned in the lectures:

- first is the clearfix hack, here is the source: https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_clearfix.asp
    * I used this in my CSS files to stop elements from going over the border when using floats. I have mentioned that I am using
    the clearfix several time as comments in the CSS files.

- Second I embeded a FORM from: https://www.123formbuilder.com/ 
    * I used embeded this FORM in contact.HTML to collect responses that I can acess throught the formbuilder website. 


Ideas for the Colour Schemes of the webiste is from: https://color.adobe.com/

I have used several images and videos which are my creations.


#Thanks again and I wish you a great day!#
